These DAO specifications were written as a contract from the tomi.com DAO and the tomi organization opened them for public comment in January 2024. This public record is created based on the fact that these are open to the public. This represents a breakthrough approach to reputation in DAOs. Whether or not tomi develops these specifications, I as the writer wanted to make them available to the public going forward.
